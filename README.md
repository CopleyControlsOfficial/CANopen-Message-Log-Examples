# CANopen-Message-Log-Examples
The following repository contains helpful message logs that customers can use as a reference for implementing the CANopen protocol over a CAN network.
Please download free CANview software from copleycontrols.com to view these logs and take advantage of CANview's helpful features: 
- Message filtering based on CAN message ID, CANopen object ID, CAN frame type, or CAN port number.
- Log decode using the CANopen EDS file. The Copley CANopen EDS file can be loaded into CANview and used to provide a helpful description of the CANopen object ID's involved in each CAN frame.
Please watch our YouTube tutorial video "CANview: Free Software to Analyze CAN Message Logs" available on the Copley Controls YouTube channel.
